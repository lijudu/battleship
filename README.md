A classic Battleship game between 1 player and computer built using jQuery.  This project was an opportunity to get comfortable using Jest and writing test suites in Javascript. 

Future Opportunities:
1. Add ability for player to manually place ships
2. Add more advanced CSS/visuals (including ship outline when hit)
3. Improve upon computer AI (ie, if player hit, try a coordinate near the hit)
